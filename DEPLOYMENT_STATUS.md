## PENDING - PyPI Upload

The package is **ready for PyPI upload** but requires your PyPI API token:

```bash
# The upload command is ready to run:
twine upload dist/*

# You will need to provide your PyPI API token when prompted
```

### To Complete PyPI Publishing:

1. **Get your PyPI API token**:
   - Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/
   - Create a new API token with scope for the entire account
   - Copy the token (starts with `pypi-`)

2. **Complete the upload**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/nemesis/OpenCar
   twine upload dist/*
   # Enter your API token when prompted
   ```

3. **Verify publication**:
   - Check https://pypi.org/project/opencar/
   - Test installation: `pip install opencar`
